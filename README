DESCRIPTION
    This Perl module distribution contains all the latest Perl 6
    documentation and a utility called "p6doc" for viewing it.

  Apocalypses
    The document codes "A01 - A33" refer to the Perl 6 Apocalypses.

    Larry Wall started the Apocalypse series as a systematic way of
    answering the RFCs (Request For Comments) that started the design
    process for Perl 6. Each Apocalypse corresponds to a chapter in the book
    _Programming Perl_, 3rd edition, and addresses the features relating to
    that chapter in the book that are likely to change.

    Larry addresses each relevant RFC, and gives reasons why he accepted or
    rejected various pieces of it. But each Apocalypse also goes beyond a
    simple "yes" and "no" response to attack the roots of the problems
    identified in the RFCs.

  Exegeses
    The document codes "E01 - E33" refer to the Perl 6 Exegeses.

    Damian Conway's Exegeses are extensions of each Apocalypse. Each
    Exegesis is built around a practical code example that applies and
    explains the new ideas.

  Synopses
    The document codes "S01 - S33" refer to the Perl 6 Synopses.

    The Synopsis documents are to be taken as the formal specification for
    Perl 6 implementations, while still being reference documentation for
    Perl 6, like _Programming Perl_ is for Perl 5.

    Note that while these documents are considered "formal specifications",
    they are still being subjected to the rigours of cross-examination
    through implementation.

    In other words, they may change slightly or radically. But the
    expectation is that they are "very close" to the final shape of Perl 6.

  Overview and FAQ
    These are shorter summaries about a smaller specific topic. They are
    written mostly by the crazy Pugs people and replacing some of the
    outdated Synopses that are still marked as [Draft].

  Tutorial (building up)
    This is an community driven effort to translate the Perl 5 manpages into
    the shiny Perl 6 world. There are still are half way through the intro.

CONTENTS
    This is the list of documents that are currently available; a number in
    the column indicates the document is currently available. An asterisk
    next to a number means that the document is an unofficial draft written
    by a member of the Perl community but not approved by the Perl 6 Design
    Team.
